; `if` evaluates exactly two expressions, in order: The test expression,
; and a matching expression. The matching expression is then returned.

; Given how 'if' is evaluated, does anything happen to 'counter'?
; Reflect on how using `if` differs from applying a procedure.

; Logical operators condense related tests and support short circuiting.
; If you've seen things like `(a && b)` or `(a || b)`, then that's what
; you are dealing with here.

;   - `and` returns #t if all following tests are #t. It stops at the first #f.
;   - `or` returns #t if at least one following test is #t. It stops at the first #t.

(check-equal? (or #f #t) "?")
(check-equal? (and #f #t #t) "?")

; Don't forget that conditionals return values. There may be gotchas.
(check-equal? (or (and #f #t) (and #t (or "nah" #f))) "?")

; You may negate results with `not`.

; The `cond` form evaluates tests in sequence, and will only evaluate the
; expressions that follow the first test that results in #t. The `else`
; clause can be used in a `cond` to handle a default case.
;
; Remember that you can switch bracket styles to help readers not get lost
; in an ocean of parentheses. Square brackets are used in the Racket Guide
; to more strongly emphasize which expressions provided directly to `cond`.
