Learn the Racket language by fixing unit tests related to language features.

Use this project if you are just starting out and want isolated exercises
to practice taking baby-steps before working on larger projects.

Test files are named after the topics they cover. When all tests run, the
test topic files will execute in an order based loosely on [The Racket Guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/).

## Usage

[Install Racket](https://racket-lang.org/download/) and make sure all of its
commands are available to your shell.

* Run `racket koans/<topic>.rkt` to run tests for a topic.
* Run `racket koans/all.rkt` to run all tests.

Read `koans/all.rkt` to see suggested reading order.

To practice, open a topic file and make all tests pass. `"?"` will
mark where you are expected to write an answer. Other times
tests will be written with intentionally incorrect code.


## Contributing

It's too early to formalize a procedure, but I am happy and grateful
to look at any PRs you open. Since this codebase consists of intentionally
failing unit tests, I cannot accept already &ldquo;solved&rdquo; exercises,
although having some passing unit tests to set context for an exercise is okay.

If you are also learning Racket, you can contribute by checking out changes
made in a PR and verifying that:

1. The koans provided make sense for their topic.
2. They can be fixed with reasonable effort.

For honor reasons, please do not spoil answers. If you must mention a possible
solution, please keep it to pedagogical discussions.

I do ask that commit messages and PR titles make it clear what topics you are
contributing toward to make history easier to scan.

## Current project goals

* Better CLI usage for run all tests, or selected tests by topic. Support running tests automatically via file watching.
* Gauge community interest and nurture growth if project is helpful.
